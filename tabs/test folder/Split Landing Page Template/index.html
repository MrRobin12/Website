            <a id="no-select" href="#" class="button">Select</a>
            <p id="no-select"><strong>The Mafia,</strong> possesses animal-keen senses and reflexes and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually any wound.  <br><br> 
                
            This healing ability facilitated the grafting of an unbreakable metal alloy adamantium to his skeleton, giving him razor-sharp retractable claws. He is also a master of hand-to-hand combat. <br><br>
                
            Tough and anti-authority, Wolverine's brooding nature and willingness to use deadly force set him apart from other, more traditional superheroes.</p>
